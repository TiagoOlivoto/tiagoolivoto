abstract = "There is a need to strengthen maize (Zea mays L.) breeding strategies based on multivariate selection to obtain high-yielding hybrids that are more stable and resilient to contrasting environmental conditions. Here, we show how the multi-trait stability index (MTSI) can be used to select maize hybrids for mean performance and stability of multiple traits. A set of 10 traits, including grain yield (GY), yield components, and plant-related traits with negative and positive desired selection gains (SGs), were accessed in 90 F1 hybrids conducted in multi-environment trials. Hybrid and hybrid × location interaction effects were significant (p ≤.001) for all analyzed traits. The MTSI provided positive gains for all the four traits that were wanted to increase (2.52\\% ≤ SG ≤ 4.86; mean, 3.28\\%), including GY (SG, 4.86\\%), and negative gains for all the six traits that were wanted to decrease (–20.28\\% ≤ SG ≤ –0.09\\%; mean, –6.70\\%), including tassel branch number (SG, –20.28\\%) and plant height (SG, –1.2\\%). We also observed desired gains for the stability of all traits. Direct and univariate selection for GY solely was not efficient to provide desired gains for all traits. The MTSI provides a unique, robust, and easy-to-handle selection process that allows identifying the strengths and weaknesses of hybrids. The index was found to be a powerful tool to develop better selection strategies, optimizing the use of resources and time, thus contributing to the sustainability of maize breeding programs worldwide."
