abstract = "Commonly, several traits are assessed in agronomic experiments to better understand the factors under study. However, it is also common to see that even when several traits are available, researchers opt to follow the easiest way by applying univariate analyses and post-hoc tests for mean comparison for each trait, which arouses the hypothesis that the benefits of a multi-trait framework analysis may have not been fully exploited in this area."
