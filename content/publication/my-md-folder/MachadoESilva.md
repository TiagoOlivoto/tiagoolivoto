abstract = "Silva, C. M., Mezzomo, H. C., Casagrande, C. R., Lima, G. W., Olivoto, T. \\& Nardino, M. (2021). Selection of tropical wheat lines based on classical and modern parameters of adaptability and stability. Bulg. J. Agric. Sci., 27 (5), 933-941 The differential response of lines to the variation of environments makes it necessary to use robust biometric tools for efficient evaluation and selection of wheat lines in tropical regions of Brazil. The objective of this work was to select tropical wheat lines with high grain yield, adaptability, and stability for the Central region of Brazil using classic and modern methodologies. For this purpose, three experiments were conducted in the agricultural years of 2018 and 2019 in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The treatments were 26 tropical wheat lines developed by the UFV's Wheat Breeding Program, in addition to two commercial cultivars (checks). Four methodologies were used of adaptability and stability: AMMI, GGE Biplot, Lin and Binns and HMRPGV. The VI 14194, VI 14127, VI 14026 and BRS 264 lines have high grain yield and broad adaptability and stability according to all four methods. AMMI and GGE biplot pointed line VI 141045 with high productivity, adaptability and specific stability for the Alto Parana\\'iba region. Keywords: Triticum aestivum L; genotype by environment interaction; AMMI; GGE Biplot; Lin and Binns; HMRPGV Abbreviations: AEC: average environment coordination; AMMI: additive main-effects and multiplicative interaction; GEI: genotype-environment interaction; GGE: genotype plus genotype-environment interaction; GY: grain yield; HMGV: harmonic mean of the genotypic values; HMRPGV: harmonic mean of the relative performance of genotypic values; MET: multi-environment trials; REML/BLUP: Restricted maximum likelihood/Best linear unbiased prediction; RPGV: relative performance of the genotypic values"
