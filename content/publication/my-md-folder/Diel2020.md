abstract = "The objective of this study was to characterize the production of biquinho pepper through the interpretation of parameter estimates from the logistic model and its critical points obtained by the partial derivatives of the function, and to indicate the best cultivar and growing season for subtropical climate sites. For this, a 2x3 factorial experiment was conducted with two cultivars of biquinho pepper (BRS Moema and Airetama biquinho) in three growing seasons (E1: October 2015, E2: November 2015, E3: January 2016). The logistic non-linear model for fruit mass was specified as a function of the accumulated thermal sum, and the critical points were calculated through the partial derivatives of the model, in order to characterize the productive performance of the crop by the biological interpretation of the estimates of the three set parameters. In E3, temperatures close to 0 \\textordmasculineC during the experiment were lethal to the plants, and a linear regression model was used in this case. The production of the cultivars in E1 and E2 were well characterized by the estimated logistic models, and the most productive cultivar was Airetama biquinho in all evaluated seasons. This cultivar also presented higher concentration of production. The two cultivars did not differ significantly with regards to productive precocity. For E3, it was not possible to interpret the parameters in the same way as for E1 and E2, since the use of the linear model did not allow the same interpretations performed for the nonlinear model, reaffirming its applicability horticultural crops of multiple harvests."
