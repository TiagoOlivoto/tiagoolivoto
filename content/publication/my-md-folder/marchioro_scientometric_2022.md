abstract = "As wheat blast is one of the most damaging disease of wheat worldwide and extremely important in Brazil, in this work we are trying to summarize the scientific research direction and temporal trends about the disease. We summarized the evolution of scientific research from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database, through bibliometrix analysis of the temporal trends of authors, organizations and journals. During 31 years, 521 publications approach wheat blast was published, with an annual growth rate of 3.86\\%. Different countries were identified, being the USA, Brazil and China the lead of publications. The main organizations are Brazilian federal institutions Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária, followed by Kobe University, Kansas State University, Agriculture Research Service of United States Department of Agriculture. A total of 168 journals were identified in wheat blast publications in bibliometric analysis, being Phytopathology the journal with most publications about wheat blast, with 14.2\\% of publications (74 documents). Considering the 521 documents, the bibliometric analysis reported a total of 1941 authors, and thirteen authors are ranked as the main authors by h-index. Among the 20 most relevant terms, in keywords and keywords plus, in the documents related to wheat blast emphasize that three main ones are related to the fungus and the culture, being “Magnaporthe grisea”, “Wheat” and “Pyricularia oryzae”. These authors, organizations and journals have a great importance in plant disease research, and in addition they are recognized by worldwide researches. In this sense, the breeding programs should be encouraged in the search for blast."
