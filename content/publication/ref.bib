abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate the coefficient of repeatability and the number of measurements required for production and quality variables in a strawberry crop. An experiment was conducted with two strawberry cultivars from two origins grown in four substrate mixtures, totaling 16 treatments, evaluated in a randomized block design with four replications. Mass (MF) and number (NF) of fruits per plant were evaluated as measures of production, and total soluble solids (SST), titratable acidity (AT) and firmness (FIR) of fruits during the crop cycle were evaluated as measures of quality. Subsequently, the repeatability coefficient was estimated by the following methods: analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis using a correlation matrix (PCcor), principal component analysis using a variance-covariance matrix (PCcov) and structural analysis (SA). The number of measurements was adjusted for each studied variable based on determination coefficients of 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, and 0.95. The repeatability coefficients ranged from low to medium. The ANOVA method gave the lowest r values, while the PCcov method presented the highest values of r. When using the PCcov method, 3.6, 2.9, 6.2, 3.2, and 3.8 measurements were needed to reach 80{\%} confidence for the variables MF, NF, SST, AT, and FIR, respectively, and this increased to 7.3, 14.0, 29.6, 15.4, and 18.1 for 95{\%} confidence in the results for MF, NF, SST, AT, and FIR, respectively.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the production of biquinho pepper through the interpretation of parameter estimates from the logistic model and its critical points obtained by the partial derivatives of the function, and to indicate the best cultivar and growing season for subtropical climate sites. For this, a 2x3 factorial experiment was conducted with two cultivars of biquinho pepper (BRS Moema and Airetama biquinho) in three growing seasons (E1: October 2015, E2: November 2015, E3: January 2016). The logistic non-linear model for fruit mass was specified as a function of the accumulated thermal sum, and the critical points were calculated through the partial derivatives of the model, in order to characterize the productive performance of the crop by the biological interpretation of the estimates of the three set parameters. In E3, temperatures close to 0 {\textordmasculine}C during the experiment were lethal to the plants, and a linear regression model was used in this case. The production of the cultivars in E1 and E2 were well characterized by the estimated logistic models, and the most productive cultivar was Airetama biquinho in all evaluated seasons. This cultivar also presented higher concentration of production. The two cultivars did not differ significantly with regards to productive precocity. For E3, it was not possible to interpret the parameters in the same way as for E1 and E2, since the use of the linear model did not allow the same interpretations performed for the nonlinear model, reaffirming its applicability horticultural crops of multiple harvests.},

abstract = {Shading greenhouse may be an effective method to achieve a suitable environment for crop growth and to enhance crop yield and quality in places or seasons where there is high light intensity. Therefore, solar radiation levels may modify the biomass accumulation and bromatological composition. Different solar radiation levels (100%, 70% and 50% of available solar radiation) were simulated in order to determine crop responses to these factors in chicory (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum). A hydroponic experiment was conducted in an experimental greenhouse in the city of Frederico Westphalen, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Plants grown in lower solar radiation levels are more efficient in converting solar radiation into dry matter, had a higher lipid content, increased chlorophyll indices a, b and total, as well as reduced leaf thickness, acid detergent fiber, cellulose, and lignin content, presenting more attractive bromatological features for commercial production. In this study it was demonstrated that the use of shading screens is an effective method to attenuate the solar radiation, this is especially relevant in places or seasons where there is high light intensity, which contribute to achieve better characteristics of the chicory produced.},

Fourteen (14) black oat populations were collected in the 2013 cropping season which were evaluated in the laboratory, and then in the field in the 2014 cropping season. The seed width has a high and positive association with physiological quality of black oat seeds. The number of grains and thousand-grain weight has greater direct effects on the grain yield of black oat; thus, these traits may be considered for indirect selection in earlier phases of future black oat breeding programs.

Three strategies were used to obtain selection gains: direct and indirect selection, an index based on "ranks," and the Smith and Hazel index. In the 2017 crop season in Brazil, 420 wheat lines from the F5 generation were conducted in families with intercalary controls. High heritability of spike weight, number of kernels, and total kernel weight resulted in the best direct selection gains. The selection of plants with a high number of tillers resulted in grain yield improvement. The use of selection indexes is important in advanced wheat lines; they promote genetic gains distributed among agronomic traits.},

Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated between the measured variables and, after that, those with greater significance were selected for productivity with the Stepwise method and verification of multicollinearity using the number of condition and inflation factor of the variance. The correlations of the selected variables were decomposed into direct and indirect effects on fruit productivity with path analysis. There was a strong correlation between the variables, excluding the variables height, diameter and average mass of the fruits. Thus, there were cause and effect relationships between the independent variable total mass of the fruits and the principal variable total fruit yield. The variables diameter and total number of fruits did not contribute to an increased tomato production.},

That way, the aim of this study was to determine the influence of uniformity trial size on the estimation of plot size in the eggplant crop. Two uniformity trials were performed with the eggplant culture in a plastic tunnel. The fresh mass of fruit and number of fruits were assessed in six harvests, with a seven-day interval between harvests. For each trial (Tunnel 1 and 2), 25 uniformity trials of different sizes were simulated (3, 4, 5, &hellip; 28 BEU) per harvest and harvest row (individual and grouped) since they presented heteroscedasticity. For each planned uniformity trial, bootstrap procedure was used to estimate 3,000 plot sizes by the maximum coefficient of variation curvature method. The mean and 95% confidence interval width was calculated by the difference between the 97.5th and 2.5th percentiles. The AIC95% and plot size averages were higher in individual harvests than grouped harvests. As the size of the simulated uniformity trial increased, it was verified a reduction of the AIC95% of the plot size. However, the mean plot size did not change with increasing uniformity trial size. In this way, it is possible to state that the size of the uniformity trial affects accuracy the plot size estimation because trials with few numbers of basic experimental units present high experimental variability and inaccurate estimates.},

Assessed traits were plant height, stem diameter, head diameter, thousand achenes weight, yield of achenes per head and number of achenes per head. Hereafter, associations between morphological traits and achene yield were verified by means of linear relations and path analysis. Thousand achenes weight and number of achenes per head exhibited linear relations and direct effects on achene yield in subtropical region at lower elevations. Head diameter does not present direct effect on achenes yield but it has direct effect on the number of achenes per head, indicating cause-effect relation and becoming an important alternative for indirect selection of sunflower cultivars.},

To do this, 18 soybean cultivars were evaluated in three field trials, sown during January in the northwestern region of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. In each experiment, a randomized block design with four replicates was used. Five quantitative traits (representing the agronomic performance of the cultivars) and 12 qualitative traits (morphological descriptors) were assessed aiming at studying the genetic divergence. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated using mixed models and BLUPs for genotypes were estimated for each quantitative trait. The cultivars FPS Igua{\c{c}}u RR and BMX Turbo RR have good agronomic performance and are, based on quantitative and qualitative traits, genetically distant. These cultivars have shown agronomic features that allow their cultivation in the second-harvest in the northwestern of Rio Grande do Sul in addition to be potential genitors for future soybean breeding programs.},

The AMMI has nice graphical tools for modeling genotype‐vs.‐environment interaction (GEI) but fails in some aspects, such as accommodating a linear mixed‐effect model (LMM) structure. The BLUP provides reliable estimates but new insights to deal graphically with a random GEI structure are needed. This article compares the predictive success of BLUP and AMMI, shows how to generate biplots for modeling GEI in MET analysis using LMM, and proposes a new quantitative genotypic stability measure called WAASB, which is the Weighted Average of Absolute Scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of BLUPs for the GEI effects generated by an LMM. We also introduced the theoretical basis of a superiority index that allows weighting between mean performance and stability, which was conveniently called WAASBY. The BLUP was found to outperform AMMI in the analysis of four real MET trials. The application of our indexes is illustrated using an oat (Avena sativa L.) MET dataset. It was shown that reliable measures of stability using WAASB may help breeders and agronomists to make correct decisions when selecting or recommending genotypes. In addition, the simultaneous selection index, WAASBY, will be useful when the selection should consider different weights for stability and mean performance. Some advantages over existing statistics are discussed. Finally, the implementation of the procedures of this article in future studies is facilitated by an R package containing all required functions.},

abstract = {Modeling the genotype × environment interaction (GEI) and quantifying genotypic stability are crucial steps for selecting/recommending genotypes in multi‐environment trials (METs). The efficiency in selection/recommendation could be greater if based on multiple traits, but identifying genotypes that combine high performance and stability across many traits has been a difficult task. In this study, we propose a multi‐trait stability index (MTSI) for simultaneous selection considering mean performance and stability (MPE) in the analysis of METs using both fixed and mixed‐effect models. Data from an MET where 14 traits were assessed in 22 genotypes of Avena sativa L. were used to illustrate the application of the method. The genotypic stability was quantified for each trait using the weighted average of absolute scores from the singular value decomposition of the matrix of best linear unbiased predictions for the GEI effects generated by an linear mixed‐effect model (WAASB) index (lower is better). A superiority index, WAASBY (higher is better) was calculated to consider the MPE. The selection differential for the WAASBY index ranged from 9.7 to 44.6%. Positive selection differential (1.75% ≤ selection differential ≤ 17.8%) were observed for trait means that wanted to increase and negative (–11.7%) for one variable that wanted to reduce. The negative selection differential observed for WAASB (–63% ≤ selection differential ≤ −12%) suggested that the selected genotypes were more stable. The MTSI should be useful for breeders and agronomists who desire a selection for MPE based on multiple traits because it provides a robust and easy‐to‐handle selection process, accounting for the correlation structure of the traits. The application of the MTSI in future studies is facilitated by a step‐by‐step guide and an R package containing useful functions.},

abstract = {The aims of this study were to characterize black oat populations by estimating between- and within-populations variance components and genetic parameters, as well as to distinguish the populations using multivariable statistics. The experiment was carried out in randomized blocks design with three repetitions, with 14 black oat populations collected in several municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul state. Agronomic important traits were assessed at physiological maturation stage. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated considering within-block information. In addition, Mahalanobis distance, relative contribution of traits, and canonical variables were used to distinguish the populations. Selection based on panicle length, number of grains per panicle, panicle weight and panicle grain weight may result in higher selection gains. Panicle grain weight presents a greater contribution to genetic divergence between studied populations. The formation of distinct groups indicated the presence of genetic variability among black oat populations in the northwestern of the Rio Grande do Sul state. Directed crosses between individual plants of populations from (i) Alto Alegre and Salvador das Miss{\~{o}}es, Chapada, or Santa Rosa or (ii) between plants of populations from Salvador das Miss{\~{o}}es and Campos Borges or Santa Rosa can generate segregating populations with great genetic variability. The predominance of between-phenotypic variance and a within-genetic variance indicate prospects for success in selection gain and possible selection of a new cultivar with fewer efforts compared to a cross-based method. This is supported by the high values of within-population heritability.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to use growth models as an alternative analysis of experiments with tomatoes. The data were obtained from field experiments of tomatoes carried out in the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 growing seasons. Six and nine harvests were carried out in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, respectively. In each harvest, the number and mass of fruits per plant were assessed. The ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to analysis of the data, and the residuals were assessed. Also for each variable, the Brody, Gompertz, Logistic and von Bertalanffy growth models were fitted as a function of the accumulated values per plant in each harvest and days after the transplant of the seedlings. The assumptions of normality, homogeneity and independence of residuals were verified by the Shapiro-Wilk, Breusch-Pagan and Durbin-Watson tests, respectively. The bias of the parameters was evaluated by the intrinsic and parametric nonlinearity, by the difference between OLS-based and the mean of 10.000 bootstrap-based parameter estimates, and by evaluating the symmetry of the sampling distributions of such parameters. Among the models tested, the one that presented a high coefficient of determination and less non-linearity was selected. The parameters of the selected model were compared by the F test. From the second-, third- and fourth-order derivatives with respect to x (days after transplant), the maximum acceleration point, inflection point, maximum deceleration point, and point of asymptotic deceleration were estimated. The residuals increased with the mean when ANOVA was used, and the data transformation did not fix the violated assumption. The violation of the model's assumptions motivated us to propose nonlinear models as an alternative to statistical analysis with ANOVAs. The logistic model had parameters close to being unbiased, and all assumptions have been meeting. Due to this, the logistic model was selected. The critical points of this model allowed assessing the productive precocity, crop concentration period and productive behavior of the genotypes during the productive period. Finally, we have shown that growth models may be an interesting alternative to standard ANOVA procedures to analyze experiments with horticultural crops in future studies.},

abstract = {Nonlinear growth models have been widely used for analyzing production curves with a sigmoidal pattern; however, all benefits that these models provide are not being fully exploited. Our aim here is to provide a step‐by‐step guide on how to choose a nonlinear model with parameters close to being unbiased, and to show how to estimate and interpret the critical points of a model aimed at determining the precocity and concentration of the production. Data on two uniformity trials conducted with eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) was used for this purpose. The Brody, Gompertz, logistic, and von Bertalanffy models were fitted to predict the number and fresh mass of fruits per plant. The model with lower nonlinearity measures and lower bias of the parameter estimates was selected. All the tested models presented satisfactory goodness‐of‐fit measures, but they differed regarding nonlinearity measures. The logistic model was selected because it had lower intrinsic and parametric nonlinearity and lower bias in parameter estimates. The inflection point and maximum acceleration/deceleration points of this model provide detailed pieces of information of the production through the productive cycle. Finally, using the logistic model as an example, we demonstrate that lower values of $\beta$2 are related to an earlier maximum production rate, and higher values of $\beta$3 are related to an earlier production that is concentrated in fewer days. The nonlinearity measures were important for the model selection. Thus, it is strongly recommended that nonlinearity is estimated and used to select nonlinear models in future studies.},

However, when the harvests were grouped, this fact was not observed. When the harvests are grouped, there was a reduction in plot size and sample needed the grouping of six harvests presented the smallest sample size and plot size. The plot size is five plants, the sample is nine plants in the direction of the crop row with a half-range of the 20% confidence interval.

Shading greenhouse may be an effective method to achieve a suitable environment for crop growth and to enhance crop yield and quality in places or seasons where there is high light intensity. Therefore, solar radiation levels may modify the biomass accumulation and bromatological composition. Different solar radiation levels (100%, 70% and 50% of available solar radiation) were simulated in order to determine crop responses to these factors in chicory (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum). A hydroponic experiment was conducted in an experimental greenhouse in the city of Frederico Westphalen, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Plants grown in lower solar radiation levels are more efficient in converting solar radiation into dry matter, had a higher lipid content, increased chlorophyll indices a, b and total, as well as reduced leaf thickness, acid detergent fiber, cellulose, and lignin content, presenting more attractive bromatological features for commercial production. In this study it was demonstrated that the use of shading screens is an effective method to attenuate the solar radiation, this is especially relevant in places or seasons where there is high light intensity, which contribute to achieve better characteristics of the chicory produced.},

Among the adjusted nonlinear models, the best adjustment for both variables was achieved by the parameterization 2 of the Logistic model and parameterization 1 of the Gompertz model, because they had lower results with less parametric and intrinsic nonlinearity.

For each scenario, homogeneity test of variances between remaining rows and columns was performed, and it was calculated the variance and coefficient of variation. There is variability among rows in trials with lettuce in plastic greenhouses and the border use does not bring benefits in terms of reduction of the coefficient of variation or minimizing the cases of heterogeneous variances among rows.

Different sources and nitrogen management (N) may increase the availability, absorption, and assimilation of this nutrient by plants, favoring the N accumulation in grains. However, little is known about the influence of these factors on the physiological quality of wheat seeds (Triticum aestivum L.). In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of different sources and nitrogen fertilization, applied in cover, on the physiological quality of the wheat seeds. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized block design in a split-design treatment plot with three cultivars of wheat (TBIO Mestre, TBIO Igua{\c{c}}u and Quartzo), three sources of nitrogen (urea, ammonium nitrate, and liquid urea), applied using five methods: (I: tilling; II: tilling and booting; III: tilling and flowering; IV: booting and flowering and V: tilling, booting and flowering). The nitrogen partitioning between booting and flowering stages results in higher physiological seed quality, since it increases the percentage of germination by 4% and positively influences the germination count, shoot length, and seedling dry mass. The sources of nitrogen ammonia nitrate and the urea liquid source are equated with urea in relation to the effect on the physiological quality of the seeds, being interesting alternatives to reduce the production cost. The TBIO Mestre and Quartzo cultivars showed seeds with higher physiological quality, due to the greater length of radicle and percentage of germination.},

abstract = {The main aim of this study was to investigate the phenotypic correlation of yield component traits using several environmental stratifications methods. We also aimed to propose cause and effect of relationships for grain yield components in soybean genotypes under several environmental conditions. The tests were conducted in the agricultural year of 2013/2014 in four growing sites in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The experimental arrangement was randomized blocks in factorial scheme (11 × 4), consisting eleven soybean genotypes in four environments with four repetitions each. All the growing environments Tapera-RS, Derrubadas-RS and Frederico Westphalen-RS were classified as favorable for soybean cultivation. The traits such as total number of pods per plant, number of branches and number of pods with 2-3 grains showed significant linear correlations with grain yield in both methods of analysis. The path analysis was applied under favorable and unfavorable environments to accurately estimate the direct and indirect effect of traits on soybean grain yield. The mass of a thousand grains and plant height were highly associated with grain yield but mostly influenced by environmental effects. The total number of pods should be prioritized for selecting superior soybean genotypes due to its direct and indirect effects on grain yield. It has shown constant in all environmental conditions. The direct effects of number of branches and number of pods (with one grain) presented distinct effects on yield in favorable and unfavorable environments.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Embrapa. The objective of this work was to evaluate the consistency of the methods of Annicchiarico, Lin & Binns, Wricke, and factor analysis in identifying eucalyptus clones with stability, adaptability, and high productive potential. Eight-four clones, with three years of age, from the genetic breeding program of the company CMPC Celulose Riograndense were used. Three field experiments were carried out in a randomized complete block design, in an 84x3 factorial arragement, with 20 replicates of one plant per plot. The clones were evaluated as to diameter at breast height, plant height, and volume of wood. The methods of Annicchiarico and Lin & Binns are highly correlated with each other, and their use together with the method of Wricke is a sound strategy for the evaluation of eucalyptus clones. The factor analysis identified broadly adaptable clones, and some of them were the same ones identified by the methods of Annicchiarico and Lin & Binns. The use of the mean classification of the clones, along with the factor analysis, is efficient to identify the most adapted, stable, and productive ones among a high number of genotypes.},

To this, data from an uniformity test carried out in a greenhouse with cherry tomato cv. ‘Lili' were used. Total fresh mass of fruits per plant was considered being these plants arranged in cropping rows parallel to the lateral openings of the greenhouse and also the same plants arranged in columns perpendicular to these openings. To generate the borders, different scenarios were designed by excluding rows and columns and using different plot sizes. In each scenario, homogeneity of variances among the remaining rows and columns was tested. There is no variability of fruit production among rows or columns in trials with cherry tomatoes carried out in greenhouses and the use of border does not bring benefits in terms of reduction of coefficient of variation or reduction of cases of variance heterogeneity among rows or columns. Plots with a size equal to or greater than two plants make possible to use the completely randomized design in the cherry tomato trials in greenhouses.},

The productive potential of this crop is closely associated with nitrogen (N) fertilization, thus, studies focused on this subject are important in the development of cropping strategies. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of N split and different type of urea on important agronomic traits of the maize crop. A randomized complete block design in a 2×2+1 factorial treatment design with four replications was used. The factorial levels were composed of two types of urea (common and coated) and two nitrogen splits (V 3 and V 3 +V 8 ), plus the control treatment (without urea application). Important agronomic traits such as grain yield, biological productivity, and yield components were assessed. It was verified that there is no difference between the common or coated urea on grain yield and its components. On the other hand, the split of nitrogen into V 3 and V 8 stages is an efficient strategy to improve grain yield as well as important features as the number of rows per ears and harvest index. Thus, by using this management system farmers can achieve a more efficient nitrogen use.},

Three PPFD levels (100%, 70% and 50% of PPFD) were investigated to determine crop's responses to this factor. Plants of escarole grown under 50% of incident PPFD had converted 0.88g of dry matter per mol of incident photosynthetically active radiation (42% more efficient compared to unshaded environment), had 26% more lipid content, higher levels of chlorophyll a, b and total (12%, 14% and 13%, respectively), 42% less acid detergent fiber, 34% less cellulose, 47% less lignin, lesser leaf thickness and better visual features. The attenuation of PPFD in sites or seasons where there is high light intensity is an effective method to improve morphological, bromatological and visual characteristics of escarole.},

abstract = {Methodologies using restricted maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction (REML/BLUP) in combination with sequential path analysis in maize are still limited in the literature. Therefore, the aims of this study were: i) to use REML/BLUP-based procedures in order to estimate variance components, genetic parameters, and genotypic values of simple maize hybrids, and ii) to fit stepwise regressions considering genotypic values to form a path diagram with multi-order predictors and minimum multicollinearity that explains the relationships of cause and effect among grain yield-related traits. Fifteen commercial simple maize hybrids were evaluated in multi-environment trials in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The environmental variance (78.80%) and genotype-vs-environment variance (20.83%) accounted for more than 99% of the phenotypic variance of grain yield, which difficult the direct selection of breeders for this trait. The sequential path analysis model allowed the selection of traits with high explanatory power and minimum multicollinearity, resulting in models with elevated fit (R(2) > 0.9 and $\epsilon$ < 0.3). The number of kernels per ear (NKE) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW) are the traits with the largest direct effects on grain yield (r = 0.66 and 0.73, respectively). The high accuracy of selection (0.86 and 0.89) associated with the high heritability of the average (0.732 and 0.794) for NKE and TKW, respectively, indicated good reliability and prospects of success in the indirect selection of hybrids with high-yield potential through these traits. The negative direct effect of NKE on TKW (r = -0.856), however, must be considered. The joint use of mixed models and sequential path analysis is effective in the evaluation of maize-breeding trials.},

abstract = {Under natural conditions, the plants are, usually, surrounded by a series of potential enemies. They had created strategies of defense against pathogens and herbivores&#39; attacks, allowing its perpetuation throughout evolution. These defense mechanisms are closely associated with the synthesis of secondary metabolites, which are also worldwide used in several areas of industry. This bibliographic review was conducted aiming to better understand how plants synthesize these substances in response to biotic or abiotic stimuli. The results discussed here revealed that synthesis of plant secondary metabolites is dependent on changes in several metabolic pathways, being often directly associated with the primary metabolism. Injury by herbivores or pathogens, temperature, CO2 levels, solar radiation and drought, are the factors related to the environment that express the most significant signs of inhibition or synthesis of plant secondary metabolites. Global climatic changes recently observed can affect the metabolic pathways network and, consequently, secondary metabolites synthesis. Nowadays, genomic tools have been useful alternatives that are leading to a new revolution of plant breeding, allowing the overexpression or inhibition of these substances. Some limitations and challenges to be achieved upon the dynamics of secondary metabolite synthesis in plants are presented. Key words: Jasmonic acid, transcription factors, inhibition, synthesis.},

abstract = {Information about data arrangement methodologies and optimal sample size in estimating the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) among maize traits are still limited. Furthermore, some data arrangement methodologies currently used may be increasing multicollinearity in multiple regression analysis. This study aimed to investigate the statistical behavior of the r and the multicollinearity of correlation matrices among maize traits in different data arrangement scenarios and different sample sizes. Data from 45 treatments [15 simple maize hybrids (Zea mays L.) conducted in three locations] were used. Eleven traits were accessed and three datasets (scenarios) were formed: (1) Coming from all the sampled observations (plants), n = 900; (2) Coming from the average of five plants per plot, n = 180; and (3) Coming from the average of treatments, n = 45. A thousand estimates of r were held in each scenario to 60 sample sizes by bootstrap simulations with replacement. Confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. One hundred eighty correlation matrices were estimated and the condition number (CN) calculated. Data coming from average values of plots and average values of treatments overestimates the r up to 24 and 34%, resulting in an increase of 24 and 131% in the matrices' CN. Trait pairs with high r require a smaller number of plants, being the CI inversely proportional to the magnitude of the r. Two hundred and ten plants are sufficient to estimate the r in the CI of 95% < 0.30. Key words: Average values, bootstrap, confidence intervals, sample tracking, Zea mays L.},

abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) has been the subject of several studies involving correlation coefficient estimates and path analysis. This critical review discusses some systematic errors that have been observed in estimating of correlation coefficients and its possible impacts on accuracy of path analysis. In a first moment, an approach about the maize crop, origin, characteristics and biometric models commonly used in genetic breeding of this crop is presented. Some obstacles found in estimates of path coefficients and the methods used to adjust them are discussed. We also present evidences and a theoretical explanation that some data arrangement methods currently used, may be overestimating the correlation coefficients in scientific studies. Data from a literature search revealing the accuracy of path analysis of some research are presented and discussed. In a last moment, we present a future perspective about how the correct estimate of the correlation coefficients may improve the accuracy of path analysis, underscoring the need for research directed to this objective.},
