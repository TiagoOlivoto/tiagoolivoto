# Getting started

`metan` (**m**ulti-**e**nvironment **t**rials **an**alysis) provides useful functions for analyzing multi-environment trial data using parametric and nonparametric methods. The package will help you to:

* Inspect data for possible common errors;
* Manipulate rows and columns;
* Manipulate numbers and strings;
* Compute descriptive statistics;
* Compute within-environment analysis of variance;
* Compute AMMI analysis with prediction considering different numbers of interaction principal component axes;
* Compute AMMI-based stability indexes;
* Compute GGE biplot analysis;
* Compute BLUP-based stability indexes;
* Compute variance components and genetic parameters in mixed-effect models;
* Perform cross-validation procedures for AMMI-family and BLUP models;
* Compute parametric and nonparametric stability statistics
* Implement biometrical models

For more details see the [complete vignette](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/).

# Installation

Install the released version of metan from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metan) with:


```r
install.packages("metan")
```

Or install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/metan) with:


```r
devtools::install_github("TiagoOlivoto/metan")

# To build the HTML vignette use
devtools::install_github("TiagoOlivoto/metan", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

*Note*: If you are a Windows user, you should also first download and install the latest version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

For the latest release notes on this development version, see the [NEWS file](https://tiagoolivoto.github.io/metan/news/index.html).
